I am a first-year PhD student at Imperial College London, working in the [DeepWok Lab](https://deepwok.github.io) and the [System and Circuit Group](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/research/circuits-and-systems/) under the supervision of [Dr. Yiren (Aaron) Zhao](https://aaron-zhao123.github.io). Prior to this, I completed both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees at Imperial College, specializing in Electrical and Information Engineering.

My research interests focus on **hardware-software co-design** and **efficient machine learning**. I am equally interested in neuroscience and neuromorphic computing. My PhD work mainly focus on **scaling computation** and new system **simulation frameworks** for emerging learning algorithms and devices.

Outside of academics, I enjoy playing basketball, cycling, hiking, skiing and photography.
